This is the final assessment project for the Udacity's Sass and Webpack course, part of the React Nanodegree Program in collaboration with FWD initiative powered by ITIDA.  The app allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. NLP is the ability of an application to understand the human language, written or oral.
